This folder is for user scripts so that scripts will be under a revision
control system (RCS) and not in people's $HOME/ directories.

This is meant to get people started with the git revision control system.

If you don't see your $USER folder in here, please add one.

# We typically have our Git Root area here.
$ cd ~/GitLab/ddr-hbm-phy-automation-team/users

# Once you cd to the users area in your git root

$ mkdir $USER
$ touch $USER/0README

  You don't need a 0README file, but if you create your user directory
  without any files in it, git won't add it. So you need at least 1 file
  here.

  The following command will stage everything under $USER, including $USER
  . Staging means you tell git which of your modified files that you are
  ready to submit to the server.

$ git add $USER

$ git commit -m "Short note about what changes you have made"

  A git commit does not 'submit' your changes to the main git repository but
  it is the next step to doing that.

$ git push origin master

  This 'git push' command is what takes your 'commits' that you have done
  and submits those changes to the git server. It 'pushes' your commits to
  the server.
