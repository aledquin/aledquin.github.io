This is James Laderoute's scratch area. It's a temporary area where James can
quickly work on a script and commit/push his changes as often as he wishes.

If James is working on a script in here but then later finds an official
home for it within gitlab then he can move the file to the offical area
and remove it from here.

When you move the file to another folder please use the 'git mv' command.
The 'git mv' command updates the index for both old and new paths 
automatically.

$ pwd
~/GitLab/ddr-hbm-phy-automation-team/users/ljames

$ ls
james_file.pl

Now James has found a home for his perl script and wants to
move it.

$ git mv james_file.pl ../../perl/bin

Now James can cd to the perl/bin area and work on it there from now on.
