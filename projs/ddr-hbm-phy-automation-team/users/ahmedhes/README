Description

The alphaHLDepotPhyvRelease_test script runs multiple testcases to ensure that the alphaHLDepotPhyvRelease runs properly. 
The script prepares the testing files, calls the alphaHLDepotPhyvRelease script, and does several checks afterwards. These
checks include:
	1- checking that the verification files were copied correctly
	2- checking the log file for fail, error, and warning messages
	3- checking the captured cmd 'alphaHLDepotPhyvRelease_cmd' file matches the GR
	4- checking the shell script 'alphaPinCheck.${MACRO}' file matches the GR
After all of the checks are done the script deletes any files it created and reverts any file that was checked-out/added to
perforce. If a single testcase was specified then the files are not deleted/reverted.

Setting up the files

First, the release area should be mapped into your local perforce:
//depot/products/training/project/t125-training-tsmc7ff-1.8v/ckt/rel/

Second, the testcase tarballs should be mapped into you local perforce:
//wwcad/msip/projects/training/t125-training-tsmc7ff-1.8v/*.tar.gz

The testcase files contains stubs for the verification files and project specific files like the legalRelease.txt and the
legalVerifs.txt files. The files are placed within a directory tree that is expected by the alphaHLDepotPhyvRelease script.

Usage

alphaHLDepotPhyvRelease_test.pl [options] <local_path>

The testcases tarballs will be unpacked in the local path supplied.
-g 	If your GitLab repository is not under '~/GitLab', '~/Gitlab' or '~/gitlab' then you can specifiy it using the '-g' option
-v	verbosity
-d 	debug

The verbosity and debug options are passed to the alphaHLDepotPhyvRelease script.

Expected output

Some testcases will output some errors anyways. The output should be compared to the output below:

Testcase 1: dwc_ddrphy_diff_io_ew
No issues

Testcase 2: dwc_ddrphy_utility_blocks
-W- The following warning(s) were detected in the log file:
  -W- The 'dwc_ddrphy_utility_blocks' utility macro should be tagged, which must be reviewed in log file:
    '${P4_ABS_PATH}/depot/products/training/project/t125-training-tsmc7ff-1.8v/ckt/rel/dwc_ddrphy_utility_blocks/1.00a/macro/dwc_ddrphy_utility_blocks.pincheck'
    Please review the tagging info following the logged 'msip_layTree' command at the end of the file.

Testcase 3: dwc_ddrphy_repeater_cells
-W- The following warning(s) were detected in the log file:
  -W- The 'dwc_ddrphy_repeater_cells' repeater macro should be tagged, which must be reviewed in log file:
    '${P4_ABS_PATH}/depot/products/training/project/t125-training-tsmc7ff-1.8v/ckt/rel/dwc_ddrphy_repeater_cells/1.00a/macro/dwc_ddrphy_repeater_cells.pincheck'
    Please review the tagging info following the logged 'msip_layTree' command at the end of the file.
