This folder's purpose is to hold scripts related to doing administration type work.

    Such as auditing files, how often files get updated, etc...

It's also meant to hold scripts that the team would use to help ensure the
quality of the releases.

    Such as linting tools.

Nothing in this area is intended to get released. If the script is later
deemed as useful enough for other than our Design Automation team then it
should get moved to the appropriate location.
