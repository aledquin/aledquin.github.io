This folder was created to demonstrate how we can do unit testing.
Using the 'Test2::Bundle::More' package.

A test script typically ends with the .t extension.

The tests can be run individually or via the provided Makefile

To run the tests using the Makefile:

   $ make test

The unit_test.t script then gets run and writes stdout to unit_test.log
This is compared against a unit_test.au; which is the last known good run.

If you don't have a unit_test.au file, you simply create one by taking the
unit_test.log and copy it to unit_test.au ; please be sure that this log
represents passing unit tests.

I would then change the permissions of this golden file, unit_test.au so 
you can not easily overwrite it by mistake.

   $ chmod 440 unit_test.au

NOTE: Over time this example will be improved to include a test harness.
      Also, documentation will continue to improve.
