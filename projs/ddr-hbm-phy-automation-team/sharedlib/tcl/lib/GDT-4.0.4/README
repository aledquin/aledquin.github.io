The stuff in this directory was downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/gds2/
It provides pair of nifty utilities for converting gds to gdt (a human-readable gds format) and back.
It also is a very handy reference for the method of reading gds files.

Original README:
------------------------------------------------------------
Use the BUILD.csh file to compile the code.
You may have to tweak the CCFLAGS and CC settings

Use perldoc, pos2man, and pod2html to create
various help formats from gds2gdt.C and gdt2gds.C

See Examples directory for how to call
from Perl.

See gds2gdt and gdt2gds wrapper scripts for one way
to support cross-platform use

Starting in GDT-4.0 you can read and write properties.
