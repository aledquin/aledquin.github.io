tdata Folder:  t=test  data=files needed by the tests in t/

This /tdata/ folder was created to hold various files in order for the
tests to be truely tested. For example, any of the subroutines that need
to read an XSLX spreadsheet would require a spreadsheet to work on. So, you
would place your test .xslx file in this /tdata/ folder.

For example:

/tdata/test01_4cols_2rows.xlsx
