This area of perl-modules (aka shared libraries) is to be considered the
golden source. All others that you find under this GitLab repo would 
just be snapshots (copies) of the golden one at a certain point in time.

When a release is planned, we assume all tools that make use of the
shared libs are pointing to the bleeding edge which would be sharedlib/dev

At the point of release, the person doing the release would create a 
versioned snapshot of what is in dev (ie. see 2022ww11).

And it is this versioned area that would be snapshoted into the release
areas. The versioned snapshot of Util should have a Util.version file
that mentions details about where the snapshot came from, which date, which
revision, who did it, etc...

The purpose of this sharedlib/ area is to prepare to release our 
perl-modules as it's own tool.

Example:
    module load ddr_sharedlibs 

The name of the Shelltools tool has not yet been determined. That is still
up in the air at this point in time.
