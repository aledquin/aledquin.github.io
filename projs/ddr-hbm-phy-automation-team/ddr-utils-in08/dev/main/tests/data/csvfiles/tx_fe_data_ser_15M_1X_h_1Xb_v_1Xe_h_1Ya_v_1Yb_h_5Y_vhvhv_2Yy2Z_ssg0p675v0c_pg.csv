Notes:-
For setup/hold arcs, index1 and index2 are transition of constrained pin and related pin respectively
For all other arcs, index1 is related pin transition and index2 is output load
Input transition is 20% to 80%
Extraction conditions for timing -
1) REDUCTION: YES
2) TEMP_SENSITIVITY: NO
3) RCC Typical DEVICE LAYERS NON DEVICE LAYERS CONLY
